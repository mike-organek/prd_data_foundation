# Data Foundation

## The Problem

Shortcuts move you quickly from point A to point B, but a "worry about it when we get there" attitude can strand you at point B.  Please contact me today at [morganek@onrdata.com &#x1f4e7;](mailto:morganek@onrdata.com) to set up a meeting to discuss how I can help get your relationship with your data back on track. 

### In our industry, point B could be:
* A quick-win Proof of Concept or initial implementation
* A first cut at a Minimal Viable Product
* A rush job to meet a deadline that slipped past
  
### Expedience can be unavoidable, but ignoring [technical debt&#x1f855;](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/technical-debt) will come back to bite you in the form of:
* Design and development paralysis following a successful POC
* Inability to address enhancement requests, performance issues, or reporting requirements in your MVP without resurrecting old bugs solved ages ago
* Bottlenecking all work through the one member of your team with an accurate mental picture of your data landscape

## The Solution

It is never too soon to start paying down your technical debt.  Get out from under the accumulating burden before it gets out of hand.  There is a [right way&#x1f855;](./relational_modeling.md) to do this stuff.

In conversations with technology leaders, it is clear that development managers and systems architects vastly overestimate the licensing and effort costs around data warehousing and SQL data modeling.  In today's technology landscape, not only are these timeless ideals affordable, but ignoring them will cost dearly over time.
