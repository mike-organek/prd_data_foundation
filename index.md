# Data Foundation

## The Problem

Shortcuts move you quickly from point A to point B, but a "worry about it when we get there" attitude can strand you at point B.

In our industry point B could be:
* A quick-win Proof of Concept
* A first cut at a Minimal Viable Product
* An appeasement to the customer to meet a deadline long past
  
Whatever the reason, ignoring [technical debt &#x1f855;](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/technical-debt) will come back to bite you with a vengeance as:
* Design and development paralysis following a successful POC
* Inability to address enhancement requests or performance problems in your MVP without bringing old bugs back from the dead
* Bottlenecking all work through the one member of your team with an accurate mental picture of your data landscape

## The Solution

It is never too soon to start paying down your technical debt.  Get out from under the accumulating burden before it gets out of hand.

The relational data model was first described in 1969 and [published by ACM in 1970 &#x1f855;](https://web.archive.org/web/20070612235326/http://www.acm.org/classics/nov95/toc.html).  When I learned about relational algebra and calculus in an undergraduate course in the 1980s, we wrote our SQL with pen and paper because there was no RDBMS implementation available to us for classroom use.
