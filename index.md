## The Problem

Shortcuts move you quickly from point A to point B, but a "worry about it when we get there" attitude can strand you at point B.

In our industry point B could be:
* A quick-win Proof of Concept
* A first cut at a Minimal Viable Product
* An appeasement to the customer to meet a deadline long past
  
Whatever the reason, ignoring [technical debt &#x1f855;](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/technical-debt) will come back to bite you with a vengeance:
* Design and development paralysis following a successful POC
* Inability to address bugfixes, enhancement requests, or performance problems in your MVP without triggering regressions
* Bottlenecking all work through the one member of your team with a mental picture of your data landscape

## The Solution

It is never too early to start paying down your technical debt.  The sooner you start, the sooner you can get out from under the accumulating burden before it gets out of hand.
