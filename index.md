## Overview

Shortcuts can move you quickly from point A to point B.  The danger is getting stuck with no way to move past point B.  

In our industry point B could be:
* A quick-win proof-of-concept
* A first cut at a Minimal Viable Product
* An appeasement to the customer to meet a deadline long past
  
Whatever the reason, letting [technical debt &#x1f855;](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/technical-debt) accumulate will come back to bite you with a vengeance:
* Development paralysis in the face of the next step
* Inability to address bugfixes, enhancement requests, or performance problems without triggering regressions
* Bottlenecking all work through the one member of your team with a mental picture of your data landscape
